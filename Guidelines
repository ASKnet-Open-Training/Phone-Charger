## Steps.
Understanding of the ideal on how to connect the all cricuit.
Identifying the tools and materials to build the charger.
Open the #ASKotek kit for the tool and materials.
Testing the battery and resistors using the voltmeter.
Drawing the the circuit digram for following the connection.
Connecting the circuit.

Battery. Positive and negative to power up the breadboard

Resistors. Connected to the power source and the LED.

LED. Positive end connected to resistors and negative end to the power source.

Capacitor 10uf.   All the end connected to the power source +v to +v and -v to -v
                          +v end connected to +v  end of regulator power input
                            -v end connected to -v end of the regulator


Regulator 5V. -v end connected to -v end of capacitor 100uf 
                        +v end connected to +v end of the capacitor 100uf.
                        
Capacitor 100uf. +v end connected to the diode
                             -v end connected to -v female USB port.

Diode.      One end connected to +v capacitor100uf.
                 One end connected to +v Female USB port.

USB Female Port. -v connected to -v capacitor 100uf 
                               +v connected to the diode.
                                The end port connected to usb male charger cable.
                               
Testing Process.  get a male USB
                    get a phone
                     Move to a direction where there is sunshine
                      Plug the male USB into the female one
                        Plug in the other side of the USB in to the phone chaerging port
                         Observe wheather its charging or not.
                           If battery bars moves, that means its working.
                             If battery bars does not move, double check your connections.
